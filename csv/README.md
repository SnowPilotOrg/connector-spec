# CSV Connector

This project contains the CSV connector, which follows the Snowpilot Connector specification.

## Assumptions

The CSV connector makes the following assumptions about the CSV files it processes:

- The CSV files are encoded in UTF-8.
- Lines in the CSV files are separated by LF (Line Feed) newlines.

Please ensure that your CSV files conform to these assumptions for proper operation of the connector.
