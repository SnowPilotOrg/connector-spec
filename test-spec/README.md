# Test Spec

This folder contains the tests for evaluating whether a connector adheres
to the Snowpilot spec. In other words, whether it accepts the required CLI
arguments and writes the expected messages to stdout. These tests do not test
the correctness of the connector logic, only that the connector adheres to the
Snowpilot spec.
